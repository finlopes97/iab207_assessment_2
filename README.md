## 0.0 Foreword
The primary purpose of this documentation is to provide a means of interpreting the various "helpful" Bootstrap abbreviations 
used in their classes, such as "me-md-0." What does it mean? That is for god to know and us to find out. During my time 
developing in this environment I have had to make ample use of the Bootstrap documentation and there is no possible way I 
would be able to decipher the various classes and modifiers being used if I were to take even a five minute break from coding. 
I also hope to document other things such that I don't need to leave comments on my code, because thorough documentation is 
preferable than ugly code comments explaining every little thing. I also like to include a readme.txt that slowly records my 
descent into madness as yet another QUT assessment destroys all fifteen of my brain cells. But this is a good thing, because 
from the scorched Earth rises a pheonix, and pheonixes are cool.
